## Information
This is a mandatory assignment for [Computer Science AP](https://www.cphbusiness.dk/uddannelser/erhvervsakademiuddannelser/datamatiker) students in the 3rd semester at [Copenhagen Business Academy](https://www.cphbusiness.dk/).

The assignment is primarily that we have to show our skills within Scrum and XP, but to show our skills we have to produce a system which consists of a REST API, a website and a mobile application which both communicates with our REST API, and to clarify our skills we need to outsource the development of the mobile application.

There is no requirement as to what the end product should be about.
